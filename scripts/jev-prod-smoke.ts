/**
 * Production-style Jev smoke — a NON-JEV CONTROL PROBE.
 *
 * Exercises the DEPLOYED relay (which holds the token server-side) with a body
 * the production generator actually produces, and checks the answer is a real
 * bounded policy with honest provenance - not a fallback dressed as a model
 * answer. Also checks the route refuses an over-large body before it touches the
 * model (Issue #37's ceiling).
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/jev-prod-smoke.ts [base-url]
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A JEV RUN. Nothing here is governed by a Jev policy: the probe
 * needs a populated city to build a realistic request from, and it drives that
 * city with the FIXED baseline — deliberately not Adaptive, so no run in this
 * file can ever be read as a Jev result or as an Adaptive-governed one. The
 * banner below says so on stdout, and no Jev provenance is produced here.
 *
 * No credentials are read, logged or needed here.
