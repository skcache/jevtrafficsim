/**
 * Pure-Jev completion harness (owner report; re-cut for the #61 contract).
 *
 *   "why does this keep happening and why is jev still being used for fallback…
 *    please track where Jev falls back and why. Also we should make sure when
 *    testing the fallback shit, we allow the run to complete without doing
 *    fallbacks."
 *
 * This is the repeatable answer. It drives EVERY curated Chicago trip to the
 * full horizon through the same world seam the app and the benchmark use
 * (`worker/challenge-compare.ts`), with the same controller the app runs, and
 * reports what the run's OWN record says (jev/telemetry.ts):
 *
 *   per route   refreshes, windows by outcome (live / held), liveMs / heldMs /
 *               invalidMs, adaptive ticks, the public provenance label
 *   per reason  how many windows each classified reason cost, and the simulated
 *               time it covered
 *   per failure WHICH refresh it was (`index` at `atSimMs`), what happened
 *               (`reason`), which policy `field`/`bound` was involved, and the
 *               run's own one-sentence `detail`
 *
 * ## The gate, stated exactly
 *
 * The execution contract is now absolute: a Jev run is Jev-derived policy
 * controlling 100% of its simulated signal-decision time, or it is not a Jev
 * result at all. A route passes when:
 *
 *   - `fallbackMs` is 0 AND no refresh window is `ungoverned`
 *     (there is no Adaptive path left to reach, and no window went uncovered)
 *   - `adaptiveTicks` is 0 (an Adaptive decision never happened)
 *   - `invalidMs` is 0 and the run was NOT invalidated: every simulated instant
 *     had a Jev policy in force
 *   - at least one live window was accepted, and the governed time adds up to
 *     the simulated window exactly
 *
 * A HELD policy is not a failure: holding a real, previously accepted policy IS
 * Jev control, and the tail after the ego arrives is reported as held time. A
 * run that LOST Jev (nothing replaced the policy before its maximum hold) is
 * invalidated, reported with the instant and the reason, and FAILS this gate —
 * it must never be read as a completed Jev result.
 *
 * Anything that fails is reported WHERE and WHY, from the run's own record. The
 * harness never retries a window, never tunes a bound and never edits a result.
 *
 * ## Clients, and the live quota
 *
 *   --client mock      deterministic stand-in. NO network, NO model, NO
 *                      credential. The default: iterate here.
 *   --client gateway   TypeSafe AI's jev through the Vercel AI Gateway, the
 *                      same client the relay route builds (JEV_TOKEN, and
 *                      JEV_MODEL to override the model).
 *   --client relay     the DEPLOYED relay route (`/api/jev/policy`), posted to
 *                      exactly as the browser posts to it: no credential here,
 *                      the deployment holds it.
 *
 * Live runs spend real quota, so they are capped: `--live-run-budget` (default
 * 3) routes per invocation, refused with a message rather than silently run.
 * Everything else about the harness is identical between clients, so a mock
 * iteration and a live confirmation are the same measurement of the same run.
 *
 *   # iterate: all six trips, no network
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/jev-fallback-harness.ts
 *
 *   # confirm live on three trips (JEV_TOKEN from the environment)
 *   pnpm tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/jev-fallback-harness.ts \
 *     --client gateway --trips soldier-field-to-navy-pier,united-center-to-willis-tower,willis-tower-to-near-west-side
 *
 *   # confirm the DEPLOYED relay path end to end (no credential needed)
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/jev-fallback-harness.ts --client relay --base-url https://jevtrafficsim.vercel.app \
 *     --trips soldier-field-to-navy-pier
 *
 *   # negative control: a stand-in that cannot answer at all must FAIL the gate
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/jev-fallback-harness.ts --mock-fail timeout
 *
 *   # loss-of-Jev control: answers once, then goes silent for good
