/**
 * Curated Chicago challenge trips (Issue #23).
 *
 * The public product no longer asks the user to choose an arbitrary city size.
 * It offers six researched, human-readable Chicago trips on the frozen Metro
 * graph. Geography is still real Chicago; this module only chooses stable
 * origin/destination anchors and materializes the route with the existing A*.
 *
 * The selected trip is evaluation/presentation metadata. Controllers do not
 * receive ego identity or route information through this module.
