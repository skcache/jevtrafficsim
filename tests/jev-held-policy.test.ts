/**
 * Holding the last good policy (measured fix).
 *
 * The defect this file pins, measured before it was fixed: a 600 s run of the
 * real app spent 26.7% of its simulated time on the Adaptive fallback — 140 s of
 * that in the back-to-back tail after the ego arrives — against a PERFECT policy
 * client with ZERO rejections. The cause was structural, not the model's: the
 * tail never turns the event loop, so an answer already in flight cannot land
 * and a one-freshness-window TTL handed the rest of the run to the safety net.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *
 *   1. the model's last accepted policy keeps governing while nothing fresher
 *      arrives (HELD), bounded by a maximum hold, and the run reports how much
 *      of its governed time was held
 *   2. the tail shape — a synchronous stretch that cannot drain the event loop —
 *      no longer costs a third of the run, proven against the OLD rule
 *      (maxHoldMs === ttlMs) run on the same drive
 *   3. every fallback says WHY, in a closed vocabulary, and a failure is
 *      classified from the transport rather than from prose
 *   4. the label names the three Jev states distinctly — never calling a held
 *      run a fallback, never hiding a fallback behind the plain word Jev
 *   5. safety stays absolute under a HELD policy: an adversarial policy at the
 *      exact bounds cannot jump a legal minimum green or emit an illegal
 *      directive, held or fresh
