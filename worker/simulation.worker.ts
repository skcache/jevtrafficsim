/**

 * Pacing: a recursive setTimeout chain, ONE fixed simulation step per
 * scheduled iteration. Browser timing APIs are used ONLY to pace execution;
 * no wall-clock value ever enters simulation state or policy. If a tick takes
 * longer than the real-time budget, the run simply advances slower than wall
 * time — ticks are never queued in an unbounded catch-up spiral.
 *
 * Cadence: one presentation frame and one metrics sample per real tick, so the
