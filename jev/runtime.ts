/**
 * Jev policy runtime (Issues #14, #61) — the lifecycle of a PURE JEV run.
 *
 * The lifecycle around the adapter/controller seam: one place that owns the
 * accepted policy, its validity in SIMULATED time, the request generation it
 * came from, and the trace of everything a scenario actually used.
 *
 * ## The execution contract this runtime implements
 *
 * A run labelled Jev means ONE thing: a Jev-derived policy controlled 100% of
 * the simulated signal-decision time. There is no Adaptive path here, at any
 * stage of a run — not at startup, not on a failed refresh, not on a transport
 * error, not on expiry. Concretely:
 *
 *   1. STARTUP GATE — no simulated time passes until the first valid live
 *      policy is accepted (`start()`). If it cannot be obtained the run does
 *      not start: the outcome says `unable` and why. Nothing else decides.
 *   2. REFRESH FAILURE — the last accepted policy keeps governing, reported as
 *      HELD once it is past its freshness window. Holding a real, previously
 *      accepted policy IS Jev control, and the run says how much of its time
 *      was held (`heldMs`) so a held run can never read as a freshly-driven one.
 *   3. LOSS OF JEV — if nothing replaces the policy before its maximum hold
 *      expires, the run is INVALIDATED (`invalidation()`): the driver stops it,
 *      keeps the measurements collected so far and reports the truth. It is
 *      never continued under another controller.
 *   4. ACCOUNTING — every simulated interval is attributed to a source, and the
 *      sources add up to the observed span. `fallbackMs` and `adaptiveTicks`
 *      are HARD ZEROS: the fields exist so a finished run can state the zero
 *      rather than leave it implied. `invalidMs` is the honest bucket for time
 *      no Jev policy governed.
 *
 * ## Time
 *
 * Every validity decision is made in simulation time. A policy is accepted at a
 * simulated instant, expires at a simulated instant, and is held for a simulated
 * minimum. Wall-clock time governs exactly two things, and neither of them can
 * change what the simulation does: how long an HTTP request may take before it
 * is abandoned, and WHEN a request may be made at all (`serviceGate`, see
 * jev/scheduler.ts — the upstream allowance is a wall-clock budget and has to be
 * spent as one). That separation is what makes a run replayable — nothing about
 * policy application depends on how fast the machine or the network was.
 *
 * ## Asking at the rate the service actually grants
 *
 * The cadence this runtime used to ask at was a SIMULATED constant (REFRESH_MS),
 * and at the shipped playback that worked out to ~24 requests/minute against a
 * service whose measured allowance is 5 requests per ~60 s window: the live
 * probe answered 10 of 30 requests, and the run was invalidated when the last
 * accepted policy outlived its hold. `serviceGate` is the fix, and it lives
 * outside this file because it is a wall-clock question: the runtime consults it
 * at each due window, and a window it declines is recorded as SKIPPED (a
 * scheduling fact) rather than as a failure. Everything else is unchanged — a
 * declined window makes no request, substitutes nothing, and leaves the policy
 * in force governing, which is exactly what the contract says a refresh that
 * produces nothing does.
 *
 * ## The one rule that makes replay exact
 *
 * A policy is IN FORCE from the first tick strictly after the instant it was
 * accepted (`acceptedAtSimMs < nowMs`). Live and replayed runs use the same
 * rule, so both apply a policy to exactly the same ticks — which is why the same
 * scenario can be replayed offline and produce the same result.
 *
 * The run's FIRST policy is the one exception, and it is not really one: it is
 * obtained BEFORE any simulated decision is made (the startup gate), so it
 * governs the run's first tick as well. A trace's first event is that policy, so
 * a replay applies it to the same first tick.
 *
 * ## What a response must survive to be accepted
 *
 *   1. the runtime must not have been reset since its request (generation);
 *   2. it must belong to the CURRENT scenario fingerprint;
 *   3. it must belong to the CURRENT request generation — a newer request
 *      supersedes an older response;
 *   4. it must not arrive inside the minimum-hold window of the policy already
 *      in force (hysteresis: no thrashing);
 *   5. it must parse, be clamped and be bounded, against the ids the request
 *      actually carried (the adapter's own parser).
 *
 * Anything else is a REJECTION: counted, reported, and kept out of the trace. A
 * rejected response never touches the policy in force, and an old response can
 * never mutate a new scenario.
 *
 * ## Holding the last good policy (the tail, and every slow refresh)
 *
 * A policy is FRESH for `ttlMs` after its acceptance and may keep governing for
 * up to `maxHoldMs` (default: four service cadences — see the constant) when
 * nothing has replaced it. Past the freshness window it is reported as HELD, not
 * as fresh: `heldMs` counts the part of the governed time a held policy
 * governed, and the run says so out loud.
 *
 * Why this exists, measured rather than assumed: the app's paced playback lets a
 * remote model answer inside the refresh window, but the run's last stretch is
 * simulated back to back (the ego has arrived; the tail exists so the visible
 * run covers the same window as its baselines) and a back-to-back loop never
 * turns the event loop, so an answer already in flight cannot land. With a
 * one-window TTL that tail was attributed to the Adaptive fallback — measured at
 * 26.7% of a 600 s run (140 s of it in the tail) against a PERFECT model client
 * with zero rejections. That is a report about the drive, not about the model.
 *
 * The rule stays a pure function of simulated time and the accepted events, which
 * is what keeps replay exact: a replayed trace holds and expires exactly where
 * the recorded run did. Nothing here loosens a safety bound — the mechanics own
 * min green, max green, yellow, all-red and starvation, and a held policy goes
 * through the same bounded translation as a fresh one.
 *
 * ## The accelerated tail
 *
 * `beginAcceleratedTail()` is how a driver says "the rest of the horizon is
 * being simulated back to back". No refresh is requested during it: a request
 * issued there could not be answered (the loop never turns the event loop), so
 * asking would only produce an unpaced burst of doomed requests — measured as
 * `rate-limited x18` against a healthy gateway. The last accepted policy keeps
 * governing the tail, reported as HELD, and any request already in flight is
 * retired so a late answer cannot be counted as a policy that governed.
 *
 * ## Why a request failed, and what an answer cost
 *
 * Every rejection carries a bounded `cause` (see `JevCause`) classified from the
 * transport, not from prose, and the status aggregates them (`causes`,
 * `lastCause`). Answers that were APPLIED but imperfect are counted too
 * (`clamped`, `dropped`), because "the model's policy governed the run" and "the
 * model's policy governed the run perfectly" are different claims and the
 * product must be able to tell them apart.
 *
 * ## Where a refresh went wrong, per refresh
 *
 * Totals cannot say WHICH refresh cost the run, so every refresh window is also
 * recorded, one event each, by `jev/telemetry.ts`: its simulated and wall-clock
 * instant, its outcome (live / held), why it was not live in a closed
 * vocabulary, the policy field and bound when a refusal named one, and the
 * simulated time the window itself spent on each source. The status carries the
 * counters plus a bounded recent-events list (`refreshTelemetry`), so a run can
 * be inspected after the fact without keeping a single byte of upstream text.
 * The record is passive: it changes nothing about what a run decides, so live
 * and replayed runs behave exactly as they did.
