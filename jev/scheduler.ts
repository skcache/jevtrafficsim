/**
 * Quota-aware refresh scheduling (the fix for routine upstream 429s).
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for, measured rather than assumed
 *
 * A live Jev run asks for a policy on a SIMULATED cadence (`REFRESH_MS`), which
 * at the shipped 8.0x playback is one request every 2.5 s of wall time — about
 * 24 requests/minute. The upstream AI Gateway / model provider does not grant
 * that. In the one controlled live probe (30 requests, 75.2 s of wall time,
 * `/tmp/jev-relay-probe-021825/`):
 *
 *   30 refreshes · 10 accepted · 20 rejected · 0 local refusals
 *   causes: upstream rate limit x19, upstream 5xx x1
 *   the run was INVALIDATED at 483.5 s: the last accepted policy outlived its
 *   maximum hold because 35 s of wall time (280 s simulated) went by with no
 *   successful refresh at all.
 *
 * Our own two layers never fired: the Vercel Firewall rule (60 requests/60 s
 * per IP) and the instance-local limiter (180/60 s per instance per IP) were
 * used at 40% and 13% of their allowances and rejected nothing. Raising either
 * would not have changed a single one of those 19 rejections, which is why this
 * module schedules around the UPSTREAM allowance instead of spending it faster.
 *
 * ## What the upstream actually tells us, from the raw responses
 *
 * Every rejected response carries the provider's own rate-limit metadata and
 * every ACCEPTED one carries none at all (checked header by header on
 * `/tmp/jev-gateway-probe-12permin.json` and `-24permin.json`):
 *
 *   429: retry-after: 40 · x-ratelimit-limit-requests: 5
 *        x-ratelimit-remaining-requests: 0 · x-ratelimit-reset-requests: 40s
 *        (six samples: retry-after == reset-requests in all six; values 27, 37,
 *         40, 60, 60, 60)
 *   200: no retry-after, no x-ratelimit-* — nothing to learn from
 *   503: no rate-limit metadata either
 *
 * Two consequences drive this module, and neither is an inference:
 *
 *   1. The window is PROVIDER-DEFINED, not a fixed client-observable boundary.
 *      The reset value counts down (40s → 37s across 2.6 s) and also jumps back
 *      to 60 s on a fresh rejection, so there is no boundary a client can align
 *      to; and the allowance itself moves with provider demand — 12 requests at
 *      5.3 s spacing passed with zero 429s in one minute, while 12.7/min took 10
 *      rejections a minute later. The advertised ceiling when the provider is
 *      under demand is `limit-requests: 5` per window of at most 60 s.
 *   2. Success teaches us NOTHING about the remaining budget, so the only
 *      signals a scheduler can use are (a) the window it observed on a
 *      rejection, and (b) how far apart its own successful policies actually
 *      landed. This module uses both and invents no third.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * Never spend the whole advertised allowance, and never answer a refusal with a
 * burst:
 *
 *   - at most `MAX_PER_WINDOW` requests in any trailing `WINDOW_MS` (4 of the
 *     advertised 5, so one request of the window is left for the provider's
 *     other callers and for clock skew — the allowance is shared, which is why
 *     it moves);
 *   - at least `MIN_SPACING_MS` between requests (`WINDOW_MS / MAX_PER_WINDOW`),
 *     so the budget is spent as a steady cadence rather than as a burst that
 *     happens to fit inside the window;
 *   - an explicit `retry-after` is respected to the millisecond: nothing is
 *     asked before it expires;
 *   - a transient failure (5xx, timeout, unreachable) backs off — doubling from
 *     the cadence up to `MAX_BACKOFF_MS` — and a successful answer CLEARS that
 *     backoff, because the state it guards against is over;
 *   - a bounded roll-up of what actually happened (`status()`), so a run can
 *     report its own service cadence instead of asserting it.
 *
 * The arithmetic, at the shipped 8.0x playback:
 *
 *   window 60 s ÷ 4 requests      = 15 s of wall time per request
 *   15 s × 8.0 simulated ms/wall  = 120 s of simulated time per policy
 *   a 600 s run                   = 5-6 accepted policies, every 15 s of wall
 *                                   time (the old schedule asked 30 times and
 *                                   was answered 10 times)
 *
 * That is deliberately the highest rate the measured allowance supports rather
 * than the lowest that would silence the 429s: 4 per window is the most the
 * service can be asked without spending the whole advertised budget.
 *
 * ## What this module is not
 *
 * It decides WHEN a request may be made and nothing else. It has no opinion
 * about policy, it never touches simulated time, it cannot accept, refuse or
 * fabricate a policy, and a refusal here is a request that was never made — the
 * policy in force simply keeps governing, which is what the pure-Jev contract
 * says happens when a refresh produces nothing. Simulation mechanics are
 * untouched: only the WALL-CLOCK eligibility of a request is decided here.
