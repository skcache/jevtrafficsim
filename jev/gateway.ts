/**
 * Vercel AI Gateway client for Jev (Issue #13, live path).
 *
 * TypeSafe AI's `typesafe-ai/jev` is an EVALUATION model, not a language model:
 * the gateway rejects it on /v1/chat/completions with "Model ... is an
 * evaluation model, not a language model. Use the evaluation generation API
 * instead." Its API is `POST /v1/evaluate`, and it takes structured state plus
 * typed questions and answers them with choices and probabilities:
 *
 *   { model, state: <any JSON>, questions: { <id>: {
 *       type: "choice",            // choice | score | boolean
 *       instructions: "...",
 *       criteria: { <optionId>: "<what this option means>" }   // a record
 *   } } }
 *   -> { answers: { <id>: { type: "choice", choice: "<optionId>",
 *                           probabilities: {...} } },
 *        usage: { inputTokens, outputTokens }, ... }
 *
 * ## Why this client only asks CHOICE questions
 *
 * The policy surface is bounded on purpose (see jev/schema.ts), so every
 * question here is a choice between a handful of named buckets, and THIS FILE
 * owns the mapping from bucket to number. The model never emits a raw number,
 * which means it cannot emit one out of range: even a confused answer lands
 * inside the bounds and is validated once more by the adapter's parser.
 *
 * Two citywide questions are always asked (switching hint, global pressure).
 * Per-corridor and per-region questions are asked for the busiest few only,
 * capped, so the prompt stays small and the model is not asked to have opinions
 * about quiet streets.
