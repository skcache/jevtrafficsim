/**
 * Per-refresh Jev telemetry (owner report: "track where Jev falls back and why").
 *
 * The runtime's own accounting answers HOW MUCH of a run each source governed
 * (`liveMs` / `heldMs`) and how much time NO Jev policy governed at all
 * (`invalidMs`). What a summary of totals cannot say is WHICH
 * refresh went wrong: a run that fell back twice for two different reasons and a
 * run that fell back once for twice as long produce the same numbers, and the
 * one thing the owner asked for — "track where Jev falls back and why" — is
 * exactly that missing dimension.
 *
 * This module is that record. ONE event per refresh window:
 *
 *   atEpochMs      when the window opened, in wall-clock ms (for correlating a
 *                  run with logs; every decision stays in simulated time)
 *   atSimMs        when it opened in SIMULATED time — what a run reasons in
 *   generation     the request generation the window belongs to (null when no
 *                  request was issued)
 *   outcome        live      this refresh produced the policy in force
 *                  held      it produced nothing; an older policy still governed
 *                  ungoverned  it produced nothing AND no policy was in force
 *                            at all. There is deliberately no `fallback`
 *                            member: a Jev run has no second controller to fall
 *                            back to, so "the safety net drove this window" is
 *                            not a state this codebase can report. A window in
 *                            this state is time the run did not control, and
 *                            `invalidMs` says how much.
 *   reason         for anything not live, one member of a CLOSED vocabulary:
 *                  timeout / rate-limited / upstream-5xx / transport /
 *                  malformed-json / schema-invalid / confidence-rejected /
 *                  stale / gap / other
 *   degraded       on a LIVE window: "confidence-rejected" when the accepted
 *                  answer's opinions were dropped below the confidence floor,
 *                  so a policy that governed with no model opinion behind it
 *                  cannot pass as a fresh one
 *   field / bound  when a refusal named a policy field: which field, and the
 *                  bound it was checked against (e.g. pressureScale,
 *                  "pressureScale in [0.5, 1.5]")
 *   detail         this codebase's OWN short sentence
 *   liveMs/heldMs/invalidMs
 *                  the simulated time THIS window spent on each source, so the
 *                  per-refresh rows add up to the run's own totals. There is no
 *                  fallback bucket to report: `invalidMs` is the honest home for
 *                  time no Jev policy governed at all.
 *
 * ## What can never appear here
 *
 * Not a response body, not a header value, not a token, not a URL, not a line
 * of upstream prose. Every string is either a literal in this repository or a
 * bounded identifier extracted from our own validation messages: the field
 * extractor recognises the message shapes jev/schema.ts produces and returns
 * null for anything else, so an unrecognised message cannot smuggle text in.
 * The timestamps are numbers and the counts are numbers. That is what makes the
 * record safe to keep after a run, to print in a report, and to hand to someone
 * diagnosing a deployment.
 *
 * ## Bounded, and honest about being bounded
 *
 * The recent-events list holds at most `JEV_REFRESH_EVENT_BOUND` events; the
 * counters (`total`, `outcomes`, `reasons`, `fields`, `reasonMs`) cover EVERY
 * refresh, and `evicted` says how many events are no longer in the list, so a
 * summary can never be mistaken for the whole history.
 *
 * ## Outcomes are resolved once, and say when they are not
 *
 * A window resolves when its answer is used (live), when its answer is refused
 * (held or ungoverned, decided by whether a policy was in force at that moment),
 * or when the window was skipped and never asked (gap/other). A window whose
 * request was still in flight when the run ended stays UNRESOLVED: it is
 * reported as such (`settled: false`, counted in `unresolved`) rather than
 * guessed into one of the three outcomes.
