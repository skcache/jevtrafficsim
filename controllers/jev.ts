/**
 * Jev controller (Issues #13, #14, #61): a citywide policy controller behind the
 * same `TrafficController` contract as Fixed and Adaptive.
 *
 * ## Division of labour
 *
 * Jev's opinion arrives as a bounded policy and is translated DETERMINISTICALLY
 * into the only two things a controller may say: "hold" and "advance".
 * Everything legal stays local: min green, max green, yellow, all-red, ring
 * order and every safety constraint are enforced by sim/signals.ts whatever this
 * controller asks for, and Jev can never name a phase, a green time or a lamp
 * state.
 *
 * The starvation rule is Adaptive's own, evaluated FIRST, on UNWEIGHTED waits. A
 * policy — however hostile, however extreme — therefore cannot starve a
 * movement: corridor and region weights scale pressure, never service
 * guarantees.
 *
 * ## The pure-Jev execution contract (Issue #61)
 *
 * A run labelled Jev means ONE thing: a Jev-derived policy controlled 100% of
 * the simulated signal-decision time. This controller therefore has exactly one
 * source of opinion — the policy the runtime accepted — and NO second
 * controller to consult, at any stage of a run:
 *
 *   - NO STARTUP SUBSTITUTION: the run does not begin until the first live
 *     policy is accepted (`start()`). Until then this controller says nothing at
 *     all, and no simulated time passes.
 *   - NO FAILURE SUBSTITUTION: a refresh that fails leaves the last accepted
 *     policy in force, reported as HELD once it is past its freshness window.
 *     Holding a real, previously accepted policy IS Jev control.
 *   - NO EXPIRY SUBSTITUTION: if nothing replaces the policy before its maximum
 *     hold expires, the run is INVALIDATED (`invalidation()`) — the driver stops
 *     it and reports why. It is never continued under anything else.
 *   - NO TRANSPORT-ERROR SUBSTITUTION: a client failure is classified, counted
 *     and reported; it never changes who decides.
 *
 * `createAdaptiveController` is deliberately NOT imported here. There is no code
 * path from this file to an Adaptive decision, and the pure-Jev test suite pins
 * that: an Adaptive module whose constructor and `directives()` fail the test is
 * loaded around a full Jev run, healthy and broken.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle (Issues #14, #61)
 *
 * Everything about when a policy is requested, accepted, held, superseded or
 * expired lives in `jev/runtime.ts`. This file is the thin seam between that
 * runtime and the engine: it feeds the runtime one observation per tick and, in
 * exchange, gets back either a policy in force or the statement that NO policy
 * is in force (the run is waiting to start, or it has lost Jev and must stop).
 * The runtime records how much simulated time each source governed, so a result
 * can never present a held opinion as a fresh one, or ungoverned time as
 * governed.
 *
 * Adaptive remains its own benchmark controller (the deterministic baseline the
 * comparison runs) and is untouched by any of this.
