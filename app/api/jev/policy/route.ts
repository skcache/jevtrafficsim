/**
 * Jev server boundary (Issue #13).
 *
 * The browser (or its worker) posts a Jev policy request here; this route — and
 * only this route — holds the service credential and talks to Jev. That is what
 * keeps the secret out of the client bundle, out of the worker payload, out of
 * browser state and out of logs:
 *
 *   - the credential comes from Vercel's request-scoped OIDC token for AI
 *     Gateway, or JEV_TOKEN for a separately hosted/local service;
 *   - the token travels in an Authorization header, never in a body, a URL or a
 *     message we log;
 *   - failure responses carry a status and a short message, never the service's
 *     own words, because an upstream error body can echo credentials back;
 *   - the request is validated here before anything is forwarded, and the
 *     response is validated and bounded before it is handed back.
 *
 * When the environment is not configured the route says so (503) and returns no
 * policy. It never fabricates one, and it never falls back to a replay or a
 * cached answer — that is Issue #14's territory.
 *
 * A failure upstream is reported to the caller as one short sentence and to the
 * operator as ONE bounded reason (an HTTP status, a timeout, or "unexpected
 * failure"). Nothing else is ever logged: an upstream body can echo credentials
 * back, and a free-form error message can carry anything, so neither is allowed
 * near the log. `failureReason` is the single place that decides what a log line
 * may say, which is what makes the rule testable.
 *
 * ## What guards this route, and what each guard is worth (Issue #37)
 *
 * | guard | scope | guarantee |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | platform rate limit (Vercel Firewall) | deployment-wide | real, when a rule exists — configured by id, see below |
 * | first-party check | per request | a browser on another site cannot use our quota |
 * | in-memory budget | ONE serverless instance | bounds a runaway caller on that instance; it is NOT a global limit |
 * | strict schema + body ceiling | per request | zero upstream calls for anything malformed |
 * | bounded question set | by construction | the route can never become a general model proxy |
 *
 * The in-memory counter is the last guard, not the wall: serverless instances
 * are created and destroyed on demand, so a caller spread across many of them
 * gets a budget per instance. The deployment-wide control is the platform's own
 * (`JEV_RATE_LIMIT_ID` → `@vercel/firewall`), which is inert until a matching
 * rate-limit rule is created in the Vercel Firewall — that step is a dashboard
 * action, and it is the one thing this repository cannot do for itself.
